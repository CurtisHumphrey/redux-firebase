All the normal firebase Reference methods are represented as redux actions

* [firebase/once](/actions/firebaseonce.md)
* [firebase/on \(for value\)](/actions/firebaseon-for-value.md)
* [firebase/set](/actions/firebaseset.md)
* [firebase/update](/actions/firebaseupdate.md)
* [firebase/push](/actions/firebasepush.md)
* [firebase/off](/actions/firebaseoff.md)
* [firebase/remove](/actions/firebaseremove.md)

Auth related \(generated by middleware\)

* [firebase/user\_signed\_in](/app_actions/firebaseuser_signed_in.md)
* [firebase/user\_signed\_out](/app_actions/firebaseuser_signed_out.md)

Also has added a few [special payload values](/actions/special-payload-values.md) to help with common patterns
